# Dynamic Agent Specialization Framework - Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Dynamic Agent Specialization Framework implements a self-modifying agent system capable of runtime adaptation, evolutionary development, and emergent specialization. This framework enables agents to dynamically acquire capabilities, evolve their internal structure (morphology), and specialize based on task demands and performance patterns.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Adaptive Agent (`adaptive-agent.ts`)

The core component implementing self-modifying agent behavior with dynamic specialization capabilities.

#### Key Concepts:
- **AgentCapability**: Represents a discrete skill or ability with strength, adaptation rate, specialization domains, and performance history
- **AgentMorphology**: Dynamic internal structure including connections between capabilities and emergent properties
- **AdaptationContext**: Environmental parameters that drive agent evolution (task type, complexity, domain, constraints)

#### Core Methods:

**`adaptToTask(context: AdaptationContext)`**
- Analyzes adaptation requirements based on task context
- Acquires new capabilities through the SpecializationEngine
- Evolves existing capabilities via CapabilityEvolution
- Adapts morphology using MorphologyManager
- Updates fitness scores and capability strengths
- Strengthens existing capabilities that match task requirements
- Records adaptation history for learning

**`executeTask(task, context)`**
- Selects optimal capabilities for the specific task
- Configures morphology for execution
- Tracks performance metrics
- Updates capability effectiveness based on results
- Adjusts adaptation rates based on performance

**`selfModify(performanceFeedback)`**
- Analyzes performance patterns
- Identifies improvement opportunities
- Applies structural and capability modifications
- Updates fitness scoring using weighted formula:
  - Performance metrics (40%)
  - Adaptability score (30%)
  - Specialization score (30%)

**`crossoverWith(otherAgent: AdaptiveAgent)`**
- Performs genetic crossover with another agent
- Creates offspring agent with combined capabilities
- Enables multi-agent evolutionary development

**`getSpecializationProfile()`**
- Returns comprehensive agent profile including:
  - Current capabilities and strengths
  - Morphology structure
  - Specialization areas
  - Fitness score and generation count
  - Adaptation history

#### Adaptation Flow:
1. Task analysis → capability gap identification
2. Capability acquisition/evolution planning
3. Morphology restructuring
4. Execution with selected capabilities
5. Performance feedback integration
6. Self-modification based on results

#### Performance Calculation Methods:
- **estimateAccuracy**: Evaluates correctness of outputs

- **calculateSpecializationScore**: Evaluates depth of specialization across capabilities

### 2. Capability Evolution (`capability-evolution.ts`)

Implements evolutionary algorithms for capability development using genetic programming principles.

#### Key Components:
- **CapabilityGenome**: Genetic representation of capabilities with genes, fitness metrics, and lineage
- **EvolutionParameters**: Controls mutation rates, crossover rates, selection pressure, and population dynamics
- **GeneticOperators**: Mutation, crossover, and selection operators for capability evolution

#### Evolution Strategies:

**Balanced Evolution**

#### Evolutionary Process:
1. Convert capabilities to genomes
2. Evaluate fitness across multiple dimensions (performance, adaptability, efficiency, stability)
3. Select evolution strategy based on population state
4. Apply genetic operators (selection, crossover, mutation)
5. Maintain population diversity
6. Convert evolved genomes back to capabilities

#### Fitness Evaluation Dimensions:
- Performance: Task completion effectiveness

const metrics = specializationEngine.getSpecializationMetrics(
  agent.capabilities, performanceData
);
```

### Agent Evolution
```typescript
// Single agent evolution
const evolved = await capabilityEvolution.evolveCapabilities(
  currentCapabilities, context, performanceData
);

// Multi-agent crossover
const offspring = await agent1.crossoverWith(agent2);
```

### Specialization Evaluation
```typescript
const needsSpecialization = await specializationEngine.evaluateSpecializationNeed(
  agent, { taskType: 'creative', frequency: 0.8, complexity: 0.7 }
);

if (needsSpecialization) {
  const specialist = await specializationEngine.createSpecializedAgent(
    agent, 'creative'
