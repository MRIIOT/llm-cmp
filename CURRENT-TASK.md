# Current Task: Create Technical Summary of CLAUDE.md Files

## Task Description
Create src/CLAUDE.md as a technical summary of:
- src/agents/CLAUDE.md
- src/core/CLAUDE.md  
- src/evidence/CLAUDE.md

Focus: How they work together

## Status
✅ Complete - Awaiting human confirmation

## Implementation Plan
1. ✅ Create CURRENT-TASK.md
2. ✅ Check project structure and verify files exist
3. ✅ Read the three specified CLAUDE.md files
4. ✅ Analyze how they work together
5. ✅ Create technical summary at src/CLAUDE.md
6. ⚠️ Get human confirmation of completion

## Completed Work
- Read all three CLAUDE.md files
- Analyzed the relationships between:
  - Agent systems (dynamic specialization + population evolution)
  - Core systems (HTM neural processing + temporal pattern learning)
  - Evidence systems (Bayesian inference + uncertainty quantification)
- Created comprehensive technical summary at src/CLAUDE.md covering:
  - System architecture hierarchy
  - Integration points between all three layers
  - Data flow patterns
  - Emergent capabilities
  - Configuration strategies
  - Performance characteristics

## Summary Created
The technical summary explains how the three subsystems work together:
- Agents use core systems for perception and learning
- Agents use evidence systems for reasoning and decision-making
- Core systems provide patterns as evidence for Bayesian inference
- All three layers create a unified cognitive architecture with multi-scale intelligence

## Awaiting Human Confirmation
Please review src/CLAUDE.md and confirm if the technical summary meets your requirements.
