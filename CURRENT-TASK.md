# Current Task: Move cmp-demo.ts file

## Request
Move `src/core/cmp-demo.ts` to `src/demo/cmp-demo.ts`

## Context Gathered
✅ Source file exists: `src/core/cmp-demo.ts`
✅ Destination directory exists: `src/demo/`
✅ Target filename: `cmp-demo.ts`

## Dependencies Found & Updated
✅ `src/demo/phase1-demo.ts` line 6: Updated import from `../core/cmp-demo.js` to `./cmp-demo.js`

## Implementation Completed
✅ Read source file content to understand its structure
✅ Search codebase for files importing from old location 
✅ Created new file at `src/demo/cmp-demo.ts` with updated relative imports:
   - `import { LLMAgent } from '../core/llm-agent.js';`
   - `import { SemanticPose } from '../core/semantic-pose.js';`
   - Other imports already had correct relative paths
✅ Removed old file from `src/core/cmp-demo.ts`
✅ Updated import in `src/demo/phase1-demo.ts` to new location

## Human Testing Required
**Please test that the project still builds and runs correctly:**
```bash
npm run build     # Should compile without errors
npm run dev phase1  # Should run the Phase 1 demo successfully
```

The file has been successfully moved from `src/core/` to `src/demo/` with all import references updated.

## Progress
✅ **COMPLETED** - Ready for human verification
