## Confidence Generation Bug Investigation ⚠️ PARTIALLY FIXED

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Confidence values repeating at 0.700 across most reasoning steps

**Root Causes Found & Partially Fixed**:
1. ✅ **Enhanced confidence assessment**: Added content quality, technical specificity, evidence analysis 
2. ✅ **Added variation**: Now seeing some diversity (0.400, 0.700, 0.900) instead of all 1.000
3. ✅ **Realistic confidence generation**: Added sophisticated confidence calculation for simulated responses
4. ⚠️ **Still mostly 0.700**: Real LLM responses still fall back to base confidence for most lines

**Progress Made**:
- ✅ **Some variation observed**: 0.400 (social step 5), 0.900 (multiple steps), 0.700 (majority)
- ✅ **Enhanced ResponseParser**: Now analyzes technical terms, evidence words, content structure
- ✅ **Better simulation**: Added agent-specific and content-based confidence modifiers
- ⚠️ **Need more diversity**: Still need more sophisticated analysis of LLM response certainty

**Further Improvements Needed**:
- [ ] Analyze sentence structure and certainty language more deeply
- [ ] Extract confidence from LLM response tone and phrasing
- [ ] Add domain-specific confidence assessment
- [ ] Implement confidence based on reasoning chain position

**Status**: ⚠️ CONFIDENCE PARTIALLY IMPROVED - Still needs more diversity

## Phase 3 Quality Scoring Bug Investigation ✅ FIXED

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Quality scoring algorithm was too generous - all agents returned 1.000

**Root Causes Found & Fixed**:
1. ✅ **Domain penalty bug**: Fixed `this.nativeDomain === this.nativeDomain` logic (now properly compares target domain)
2. ✅ **Quality scoring too generous**: Implemented more discriminating formula with realistic 0.3-0.95 range
3. ✅ **Insufficient discrimination**: Added depth, diversity, coherence, and flow analysis factors
4. ✅ **Confidence inflation**: Added realism penalties for overconfident reasoning

**Results After Fix**:
- ✅ **Quality scores now range 0.529-0.658** (realistic discrimination)
- ✅ **Reasoning specialist highest (0.658)** - correctly identified as best performer
- ✅ **Critical specialist lowest (0.529)** - correctly penalized for excessive length (83 steps)
- ✅ **Meaningful differentiation** between agent performance types
- ✅ **Specialized behaviors preserved** with distinct quality assessments

**Quality Score Improvements**:
- Added depth quality assessment (optimal 15-40 reasoning steps)
- Added diversity quality (balanced type variety)  
- Added coherence quality (logical flow and concept consistency)
- Added specialization bonus (using preferred reasoning types)
- Added domain compatibility penalties
- Added confidence realism checks (penalize overconfidence)

**Status**: ⚠️ CONFIDENCE GENERATION BUG - Values repeating at 0.700
**Next Action**: Fix confidence assessment and diversify confidence values
