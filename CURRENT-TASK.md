- `src/prediction/hierarchical/` - Hierarchical prediction system
- `src/prediction/error-signals/` - Error signal processing
- `src/prediction/integrated/` - Integrated predictive coding

#### 8. **Game-Theoretic Consensus** - Missing Entirely
**No Current Implementation** → Complete new consensus systems:
- `src/consensus/game-theory/` - Strategic voting mechanisms
- `src/consensus/coalitions/` - Coalition formation algorithms
- `src/consensus/temporal/` - Temporal consensus tracking

### **PRESERVED COMPONENTS:**

#### Infrastructure Components (Will be Enhanced but Not Obsoleted):
- `src/models/` - LLM interface adapters (will be enhanced for sophisticated prompting)
- `src/config/` - Configuration loading (will be extended for new parameters)  
- `src/types/` - Type definitions (will be significantly extended)
- `src/mcp/` - MCP integration (will be enhanced for sophisticated data flows)

### **OBSOLESCENCE IMPACT ANALYSIS:**

**High Impact Obsolescence (>90% replacement):**
- Core reasoning mechanisms (semantic-pose, consensus building)
- Agent specialization and coordination
- Evidence processing and integration

**Medium Impact Obsolescence (50-90% replacement):**  
- Base agent functionality and capabilities
- Orchestration coordination mechanisms

**Low Impact Obsolescence (<50% replacement):**
- Infrastructure and interface components
- Configuration and utility functions

### **TRANSITION STRATEGY:**

**Phase 1:** Implement new sophisticated foundations alongside existing (co-existence)
**Phase 2:** Migrate orchestration to use new sophisticated components
**Phase 3:** Replace old implementations with new sophisticated versions
**Phase 4:** Remove obsoleted classes and clean up dependencies

## Practical Example: Business Expansion Scenario

### **Business Query:** 
*"Should we expand our SaaS company into the European market, and what would be the implementation strategy?"*

## **CURRENT ARCHITECTURE (Simple) vs NEW ARCHITECTURE (Sophisticated)**

### **1. AGENT SPECIALIZATION**

**Current (Static):**
```
7 Fixed Agents Always Used:
- reasoning_specialist: General logical analysis
- creative_specialist: General ideation  
- factual_specialist: General knowledge retrieval
- code_specialist: General technical analysis
- social_specialist: General communication
- critical_specialist: General risk analysis
- meta_coordinator: General orchestration
```

**New (Dynamic & Adaptive):**
```
Query Analysis → Spawns Specialized Agents Based on Complexity:
- market_expansion_specialist (evolved from reasoning + factual)
- regulatory_compliance_specialist (evolved from factual + critical)
- technical_infrastructure_specialist (evolved from code + reasoning)
- cultural_adaptation_specialist (evolved from social + creative)
- competitive_analysis_specialist (evolved from factual + critical)
- financial_modeling_specialist (evolved from reasoning + critical)
- implementation_strategy_specialist (evolved from coordinator + reasoning)

Agent Pool Size: 12-15 agents (dynamically optimized for this query type)
Specialization Depth: 90%+ domain-specific capabilities
```

### **2. TEMPORAL SEQUENCE PROCESSING**

**Current (No Temporal Processing):**
```
- No memory of previous expansion discussions
- No learning from past expansion patterns
- No sequence prediction capabilities
- Each query processed in isolation
```

**New (Hierarchical Temporal Memory):**
```
HTM Integration:
1. Retrieval: "Similar expansion analysis from 6 months ago"
2. Pattern Recognition: "Regulatory analysis → market sizing → technical feasibility" sequence pattern
3. Prediction: "Next likely question: 'What's our GDPR compliance timeline?'"
4. Episodic Memory: Successful expansion patterns from 15 similar SaaS companies
5. Sequence Learning: Improving reasoning chains for market expansion queries

Temporal Context:
- 18-month expansion timeline prediction
- Seasonal market entry timing optimization
- Regulatory deadline sequence awareness
```

### **3. EVIDENCE INTEGRATION**

**Current (Simple Map Aggregation):**
```
Evidence Processing:
- Agent 1: "Market size: €50B" (confidence: 0.8)
- Agent 2: "Market size: €45B" (confidence: 0.7)  
- Result: Simple average = "€47.5B" (confidence: 0.75)

No conflict resolution
No uncertainty quantification
No source reliability tracking
```

**New (Bayesian Uncertainty Reasoning):**
```
Advanced Evidence Synthesis:
Input Sources:
- Agent 1: "Market size: €50B" (confidence: 0.8, source: Gartner 2024)
- Agent 2: "Market size: €45B" (confidence: 0.7, source: industry analysis)
- Agent 3: "Market size: €52B" (confidence: 0.9, source: McKinsey 2024)

Bayesian Integration:
1. Source Reliability Assessment: Gartner (0.9), McKinsey (0.95), Industry (0.6)
2. Conflict Detection: 15% variance in estimates
3. Uncertainty Quantification: "€50.2B ± €3.1B (95% confidence interval)"
4. Meta-Evidence: "Variance suggests rapid market growth, estimates likely conservative"

Evidence Graph: Market Size → Customer Segments → Revenue Potential → Risk Assessment
```

### **4. CONSENSUS BUILDING**

**Current (Simple Averaging):**
```
Consensus Process:
- Collect agent responses
- Average confidence scores with small bonuses
- Threshold check (>0.7 = consensus)
- Single-pass consensus decision

Example:
Agent confidences: [0.8, 0.7, 0.9, 0.6, 0.8]
Result: 0.76 average → "Consensus achieved"
```

**New (Game-Theoretic Multi-Layer Consensus):**
```
Strategic Consensus Process:

Layer 1: Individual Agent Assessments
- market_expansion_specialist: "Expand to Germany first" (confidence: 0.85)
- regulatory_specialist: "Start with UK for easier transition" (confidence: 0.90)
- technical_specialist: "France for technical infrastructure" (confidence: 0.75)

Layer 2: Coalition Formation
Coalition A (UK-first): [regulatory_specialist, cultural_specialist] 
Coalition B (Germany-first): [market_specialist, financial_specialist, competitive_specialist]
Coalition C (Multi-market): [technical_specialist, implementation_specialist]

Layer 3: Strategic Voting
- Mechanism design reveals true preferences (not strategic voting)
- Nash equilibrium analysis finds stable solution
- Incentive-compatible outcome

Layer 4: Temporal Consensus Tracking
- Historical consensus patterns show Germany-first has 78% success rate
- Drift detection identifies evolving regulatory landscape
- Consensus stability projection: 6 months

Final Multi-Layer Result:
"Coalition consensus: Germany-first expansion with UK regulatory framework preparation"
Consensus confidence: 0.91 (stable across all layers)
```

### **5. SEMANTIC POSE OPERATIONS**

**Current (Basic Vector Operations):**
```
Business Transformation:
technical_domain → business_domain
- Hardcoded matrix: [[0.7, 0.3], [0.2, 0.8]]
- Simple matrix multiplication
- Fixed confidence penalty: 0.8
```

**New (Manifold-Aware Processing):**
```
Sophisticated Semantic Navigation:
Business Expansion Manifold:
1. Market Analysis (regulatory, competitive, cultural)
2. Technical Infrastructure (compliance, scalability, integration)  
3. Financial Modeling (revenue, costs, ROI, risk)
4. Implementation Strategy (timeline, resources, milestones)

Geodesic Path Planning:
technical_feasibility → regulatory_compliance → market_opportunity → financial_viability
- Manifold curvature reveals regulatory complexity bottleneck
- Optimal transformation path avoids compliance "cliff edges"
- Context-aware pose prediction for next reasoning steps

Adaptive Reference Frames:
- SaaS expansion frame (learned from 50+ similar analyses)
- European regulatory frame (GDPR, data residency, tax)
- Cross-border business frame (cultural, operational, legal)
```

### **6. PREDICTIVE CODING & ANTICIPATION**

**Current (No Predictive Capabilities):**
```
- No anticipation of follow-up questions
- No prediction of implementation challenges
- No proactive risk identification
- No timeline predictions
```

**New (Integrated Predictive Coding):**
```
Hierarchical Predictions:

Level 1 - Immediate Next Steps:
- Predicts user will ask about GDPR compliance (94% confidence)
- Anticipates questions about local hiring (87% confidence)
- Expects technical infrastructure deep-dive (82% confidence)

Level 2 - Implementation Sequence:
- Market research phase: 2-3 months
- Regulatory compliance setup: 4-6 months  
- Technical infrastructure: 3-4 months
- Beta customer acquisition: 6-8 months

Level 3 - Risk Predictions:
- Currency fluctuation impact modeling
- Competitive response predictions
- Regulatory change anticipation (upcoming EU AI Act implications)

Error-Driven Learning:
- Previous prediction: "3-month GDPR compliance" was 2 months optimistic
- Learning signal: Adjust regulatory timeline predictions +40%
- Meta-prediction: "Our regulatory predictions tend to be optimistic"
```

### **7. COMPLETE REASONING CHAIN COMPARISON**

**Current Simple Flow:**
```
1. Query → Static 7 agents
2. Parallel processing (no coordination)
3. Simple evidence aggregation
4. Threshold-based consensus
