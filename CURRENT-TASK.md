# CURRENT TASK: Investigate Sequence Generation Consistency

## Initial Understanding
- Issue: Temporal pooler has 4,636 learned segments but ZERO overlap with current winner cells during testing
- Root cause theory: Training and testing phases may be using different sequences despite calling same generateDeterministicSequences() function
- Previous attempt to add debug output failed (text replacement didn't find target)

## Context from Investigation
- Learning phase: 4,636 segments created successfully ✅
- Testing phase: 38 winner cells present consistently ✅
- Problem: **ZERO overlap between trained segments and testing winner cells** ❌
- Debug output shows: "0 segments with overlap > 0, max overlap = 0" on every prediction

## Current Status
⚠️ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Invalid Cell IDs in Synapses**

## CRITICAL BUG FOUND
The temporal pooler is creating synapses with INVALID presynaptic cell IDs!

**Evidence:**
- Maximum valid cell ID = 8191 (256 columns × 32 cells/column - 1)
- Synapses contain cell IDs like 30880, 55744, 64288 - **way beyond valid range!**
- These invalid IDs cause zero overlap during prediction

## Investigation Progress
✅ Examined the `sampleArray` method - implementation looks correct
✅ Added debug validation in multiple locations:
   - `createNewSegment`: Check for invalid IDs in previousState.winnerCells
   - `processActiveColumns`: Validate winner cell IDs when adding
   - `deepCopyState`: Check for corruption during state copying

## Debug Code Added
1. **In createNewSegment**: Validates cell IDs before creating synapses
2. **In processActiveColumns**: Validates winner cells for both predicted and bursting columns  
3. **In deepCopyState**: Checks for invalid IDs during state copying

## Next Steps
⚠️ **Run the test again with new debug output to identify WHERE invalid cell IDs are introduced**

The debug output will show:
- If invalid IDs exist in previousState.winnerCells when creating segments
- If invalid IDs are generated when choosing winner cells
- If state copying corrupts the data

## Why This Causes Zero Predictions
- During testing, segments have synapses to invalid cell IDs (30880, 55744, etc.)
- These IDs don't exist in the valid cell range (0-8191)
- When checking overlap, no valid cells match these invalid IDs
- Result: Zero overlap, zero predictions
