# Current Task: Integrate MTConnect MCP Server

## Request
Integrate user's custom MTConnect MCP server for manufacturing device monitoring into multi-agent system

## MTConnect Server Details

### **üîå Connection Information**
```json
{
  "transport": "stdio",
  "command": "node", 
  "args": ["C:/source/llm/mtconnect-mcp-server/debug-wrapper.js"],
  "env": {
    "DEBUG_MODE": "true",
    "DEBUG_PORT": "9229", 
    "MCP_MODE": "true",
    "MTCONNECT_MQTT_HOST": "mqtt://demo.mtconnect.org:1883",
    "MTCONNECT_QUALITY_ALERTING": "true",
    "MTCONNECT_MAX_HISTORY": "100",
    "MTCONNECT_QUALITY_THRESHOLD_HEALTHY": "95.0",
    "MTCONNECT_QUALITY_THRESHOLD_DEGRADED": "80.0"
  }
}
```

### **üõ†Ô∏è Server Capabilities**
**7 Tools Available:**

1. **mqtt_reconnect** - Force MQTT client reconnection
2. **list_devices** - List MTConnect devices with quality status
3. **show_device** - Detailed device information and components
4. **show_device_current_state** - Current state of all device observations
5. **show_observation** - Specific observation data from device components  
6. **show_latest_observations** - Recent observations within time window
7. **show_latest_observations_by_id** - Recent observations aggregated by dataItemId

### **üéØ Use Case Domain**
**Manufacturing/Industrial IoT**: Monitoring CNC machines, quality tracking, device health analysis

**Key Insights Needed:**
- Device health and quality status monitoring
- Production efficiency analysis
- Machine utilization tracking  
- Predictive maintenance indicators
- Real-time operational status

## Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: MTConnect Client Integration** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
1. **Create MTConnect MCP Client** ‚úÖ
   - MTConnect client added to `mcp-client.ts`
   - stdio transport configured with your connection details
   - Environment variables properly set for MTConnect config

2. **Update Agent System** ‚úÖ
   - Coordinator agent understands manufacturing domain
   - Manufacturing-specific analysis patterns added
   - Agent prompts updated for MTConnect data interpretation

### **Phase 2: Manufacturing Agent Enhancements** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
3. **Enhance Data Agent** ‚úÖ
   - MTConnect-specific data processing implemented
   - Device observations and quality metrics handling added
   - Time-series manufacturing data processing ready

4. **Enhance Analysis Agent** ‚úÖ
   - Manufacturing KPI calculations available
   - Device health assessment logic implemented
   - Quality trend analysis capabilities added

### **Phase 3: Demo Implementation** ‚ö†Ô∏è READY FOR TESTING
5. **Build Manufacturing Demo**
   - Create demo queries for device monitoring
   - Show coordinated analysis across agents
   - Demonstrate real MTConnect data insights

6. **Test with Real MTConnect Data**
   - Connect to demo.mtconnect.org MQTT broker
   - Validate data processing pipeline
   - Verify agent coordination works with manufacturing data

### **Human Test Checkpoints**
- **Checkpoint 1**: After Phase 1 - Test MCP client connection and tool access
- **Checkpoint 2**: After Phase 2 - Test enhanced agents with MTConnect data  
- **Checkpoint 3**: After Phase 3 - Test full demo with coordinated analysis

## Progress
‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - MTConnect MCP Client Integration (Phase 1)
‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Manufacturing Agent Enhancements (Phase 2)  
‚úÖ **FIXED** - All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
‚úÖ **ADDED** - Missing npm script `demo:mcp-integration` added
‚úÖ **FIXED** - Configuration loading added to demo
‚ö†Ô∏è **FIXED** - MCP response parsing corrected for device data extraction
‚úÖ **ADDED** - Debug run configurations for IDE debugging (JetBrains + VS Code)

## Current Issue
**RESOLVED** - MCP response parsing fixed. Server is responding correctly with 2 manufacturing devices:
- OKUMA (uuid: OKUMA.123456, status: online, data quality: critical - 71.6% availability)
- Mazak (uuid: Mazak, id: d1, status: online, data quality: critical - 74.8% availability)

## Next Action Required
**Ready for testing and debugging**:
- **Run**: `npm run demo:mcp-integration` for normal execution
- **Debug**: Use IDE run configuration "Debug MCP Integration (Direct)" for step-by-step debugging
- MTConnect server communication is working (2 devices found: OKUMA and Mazak)
- Response parsing has been fixed to extract device arrays properly
- Should now proceed through full multi-agent analysis

### Available Debug Configurations:

**JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ/WebStorm):**
1. **Debug MCP Integration (Direct)** - Direct Node.js debugging with breakpoints
2. **Debug MCP Integration (npm)** - Debug via npm script  
3. **Build TypeScript** - Compile TypeScript before debugging

**VS Code:**
1. **Debug MCP Integration Demo** - Direct TypeScript debugging with source maps
2. **Debug MCP Integration (via npm)** - Debug through npm script execution

### To Debug:
- **JetBrains**: Select run configuration from dropdown and click Debug button
- **VS Code**: Open Run and Debug panel (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+D) and select configuration
