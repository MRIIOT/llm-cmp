# HTM Sequence Learning Failure Investigation

## Problem Summary
The HTM sequence learning test is showing complete failure:
- **0% prediction accuracy** across all repetitions 
- **0 predictive cells** in all temporal states
- **No learning** occurring (learning rate 0.00%)
- **Spatial processing works** (different columns activate correctly)
- **Temporal relationships not being learned**

## Root Cause Analysis ✅

### Primary Issues Identified:

1. **Test Configuration Problem**: 
   - `enableSpatialLearning: false` prevents stable column activations
   - Only 1 column active per pattern (insufficient for temporal learning)
   - Pattern size (100) → HTM size (50 columns) creates poor spatial mapping

2. **Temporal Pooler Configuration Issues**:
   - `activationThreshold: 13` too high for single-column patterns
   - Each pattern activates only 4 cells from 1 column 
   - Segments need ~13 connected synapses but only 4 cells available as presynaptic
   - Mathematically impossible to reach activation threshold

3. **Architectural Mismatch**:
   - Test expects: A→B→C→D sequence learning with 1 active column each
   - HTM Reality: Needs multiple columns active to form reliable temporal patterns
   - Current design fundamentally prevents segment formation

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Code Analysis ✅
- [x] Examine HTM Region implementation for temporal learning logic
- [x] Check TemporalPooler configuration and synaptic learning
- [x] Review ColumnStateManager temporal state management
- [x] Analyze test setup and pattern generation

### Phase 2: Root Cause Identification ✅
- [x] **CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND**: Test configuration has `enableSpatialLearning: false` but spatial pooler must generate stable activations for temporal pooler to learn
- [x] Identified temporal pooler configuration problems:
  - `activationThreshold: 13` is too high for small patterns (4 active cells → only 1 column active)
  - Need ~4-8 synapses connecting for prediction, but test only has 1 column per pattern
  - Segments need multiple synapses from different winner cells to reach threshold
- [x] Found spatial-temporal coupling issue:
  - Test expects 1 active column per pattern, but temporal learning needs multiple columns
  - Current test design fundamentally prevents sequence learning
- [x] Verified prediction logic is correct but can't work with current test parameters

### Phase 3: Fix Implementation ✅
- [x] **Fix Test Configuration**:
  - ✅ Enable spatial learning (`enableSpatialLearning: true`) 
  - ✅ Increase active bits per pattern (from 4 to 20 bits)
  - ✅ Lower temporal activation threshold (from 13 to 6)
  - ✅ Adjust pattern generation for realistic sequence learning
- [x] **Optimize HTM Parameters**:
  - ✅ Set appropriate activationThreshold for multi-column patterns
  - ✅ Adjust initialPermanence to ensure immediate connectivity  
  - ✅ Tune learning rates for faster convergence
- [ ] **CURRENT ISSUE**: Spatial pooler still only activating 1 column per pattern
  - Problem: 20 input bits → 1 output column (need 3-5 columns)
  - Solution: Adjust spatial pooler sparsity and inhibition parameters
- [ ] **Add Better Debugging**: Track segment formation and synapse counts

### Phase 4: Verification ⚠️
- [ ] Run test to confirm learning now occurs
- [ ] Verify prediction accuracy improves over repetitions
- [ ] Check predictive cells are generated properly
- [ ] Document resolution and update permanent docs

## Files to Examine
- Test file: `/tests/test-htm-sequence-learning.js`
- HTM implementation: `/core/htm/` directory
- TemporalPooler: Look for temporal learning logic
- ColumnStateManager: Check predictive state handling

## Expected Behavior
After fixes, the test should show:
- Prediction accuracy increasing over repetitions (target: >80% by repetition 10)
- Predictive cells appearing in temporal states
- Learning rate > 0%
- Successful pattern predictions

## Current Status
⚠️ **INVESTIGATION PHASE** - Analyzing code to identify root cause of temporal learning failure
